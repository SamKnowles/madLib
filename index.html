      <h2>Christmas Tree</h2>
      <p id="christree"> Every Christmas we <span class ="verb"></span> to a <span class ="adjective"></span> tree farm far away. This is not just any <span class ="adjective"></span> tree farm. My dad and I   <span class ="verb"></span>  onto the   <span class ="noun"></span>   to   <span class ="verb"></span>  for the perfect   <span class ="noun"></span>  .  Some people like them <span class ="adjective"></span>, but I prefer them <span class ="adjective"></span>. After  searching for hours I usually  <span class ="adverb"></span>  exclaim "Dad! The perfect tree is over   there!" Off we   <span class ="verb"></span>  to get the tree. The problem is we always forget the  <span class ="noun"></span>   and the  <span class ="noun"></span>  . But at the end of the day we   <span class ="adverb"></span>  get the tree and head home   <span class ="adverb"></span> . "I wish it was Christmas all year round"  I   <span class ="adverb"></span>  think to myself. </p>

      <h2>Shopping</h2>
      <p id="shop">Today I went shopping. When I arrived at the store I saw a  <span class ="adjective"></span>    <span class ="noun"></span>  , who upon noticing me    <span class ="adverb"></span>   said "I need to   <span class ="verb"></span>  ". "Well,   that was  <span class ="adjective"></span> " I thought to myself and walked in the store. The store had rearranged it\s inventory, so I felt    <span class ="adverb"></span>   lost. I   walked up to store clerk and said    <span class ="adverb"></span>   "I am looking for a  <span class ="adjective"></span>    <span class ="noun"></span>   that doesnâ€™t    <span class ="verb"></span>   as often as the last one I had." The store clerk    looked at me with a  <span class ="adjective"></span>  look in his eye and said, "What you are looking for can be found by the   <span class ="noun"></span>  , if you see a   <span class ="noun"></span>   that    <span class ="adverb"></span>   can    <span class ="verb"></span>  , then you've gone too far." As I tried to understand his directions, I thought to myself, "I should have just ordered it    on amazon.com, Their products seem to    <span class ="verb"></span>   the perfect amount"</p>

      <h2>Brainstorm</h2>
      <p id="brain">Many say that brainstorming is  <span class ="adjective"></span>  and does not   <span class ="verb"></span>  . However, with the combination of the right computer and   <span class ="noun"></span>   anyone  can lead a good    <span class ="verb"></span>  . When you have    <span class ="adverb"></span>   pulled together a  <span class ="adjective"></span>     group of   <span class ="noun"></span>   in a big room with lots of TV\s then  magical things will happen. In the past we have    <span class ="adverb"></span>   suggested  participants work together to find the most  <span class ="adjective"></span>  solution. The   most difficult part is many  <span class ="adjective"></span>    <span class ="noun"></span>   like to   <span class ="verb"></span> . This has proved to be    <span class ="adverb"></span>   problematic.  But in the end the most important   <span class ="noun"></span>   usually is brought to light.  Typically we try to encourage ideas to    <span class ="verb"></span>  , and never shut ideas  down. This concludes our instructions. Thanks for    <span class ="adverb"></span>   listening!</p>
